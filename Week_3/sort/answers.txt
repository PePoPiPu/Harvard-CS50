sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It's the sort that takes longer on reversed txt files but it's the one that takes the shortest time when going through already sorted files.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It's the sort that takes less time. When sorting through an already sorted file it takes longer than sort1 since it has to merge the arrays back together.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It seems like it iterates over each of the elements of the txt file. When going through a sorted file it takes the longest, seeming like it iterates through everything.
