Flask
A file path can be called a route.
route?key=value, route?key=value&key=value

GET /search?q=cats HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
...

We are going to create a server that handles the "parsing". The extraction of the url query. We are going to learn Flask and Jinja.

Flask is a framework. A third party library. Works with python
Jinja allows us to use placeholders in our webpages.

In the terminal we'll use flask run instead http-server.
We would need 2 files:

app.py
templates/file.html's

The most common convention:

app.py
requirements.txt
static/ (css files, images, javascript files, etc.)
templates/


from flask import Flask, rendenr_template
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")
