Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
With a small number of simulations, it proves incorrect
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
    After 100000. Simulations don't even reach the second of run time and results are near enough.
