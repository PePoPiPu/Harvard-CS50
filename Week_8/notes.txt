Internet
    The early days of the Internet:
    The internet started by connecting universities with ArpaNet

    Routing decisions and routers:

    Data takes routes. That's why it's called a router.
    Data can take different paths from A to B.

    TCP/IP:
    They do 2 things:
        IP: Internet Protocol. Allow computers to know how to address information. They're protocols full of conditionals.
        IP decides that every computer of the world have a unique address. #.#.#.# Dotted decimal notation.
        The numbers uniquely identify computers around the world. Each number goes up to 255. An IP address is 32 bits in total.
        We can have a total of 4 billion computers on the internet at once. There's a newer version of IP called IPv6 that uses 128 bits.

        TCP: Transmission Control Protocol. Set of conventions to solve problems like figuring out what type of internet service is received.

        80 HTTP
        443 HTTPS
        443 Is the port number. It goes after the IP address.
        ...

        1.2.3.4.443

        TCP also can allow you to take a big file and fragment it into pieces.
        A router can drop a packet of data if it's really busy. If the receiving router is missing a packet of data, it can ask the other router to
        just resend the missing packet instead of the whole file.


    Internet needs to be user-friendly:

        We can convert strings to IP addresses with DNS Domain Name System. It can do it viceversa.
        DNSs hold a kind of hash tables with keys and values with Domain Names and IP Addresses

        Fully Qualified Domain Names: www.google.com
        Domain Name: google.com

HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
    It's a service that runs on top the internet. HTTP is the application level protocol. The internet is the "underlying plumbing".

    https://www.example./

    A single slash means "give me that page default". Hitting enter implies having the slash.

    https://www.example.com/path
    https://www.example.com/folder/file.html

    .com is the Top Level Domain (TLD)
    .com meant commercial.
    CCTLD Country Code Top Level Domain .uk .es .us, etc.
    Nowadays TLDs and CCTLDs usually mean where the Domain is located.

    WWW is the host name.
    HTTPS is the protocol to use to access the content in that address.

    https protocols:
    GET (download)
    POST (upload)

    ...
    When visting example.com, the packet of data sent to the server contains the following:
    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.com
    Incognito mode allows software developers to always have a clean slate in the browser.
    In inspect mode in chrome we can use the network tab to see these packets of data and lower level details.

    We can see request headers. All the lines of text sent from our computer to the server. They are key:value pairs.
    We expect an http response:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK (status code)
    Content-Type: text/html

    ...


Terminal:

    Curl command: Connect URL
    Getting a response of 301 makes the browser visit the new location URL.
    HTTP can bounce around the user to get the correct locations

    Common exit status:
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    Content-Type: text/html
    ...

    200 OK
    301 Moved Permanently
    302 Found
    304 Not Modified
    307 Temporary Redirect
    401 Unauthorized
    403 Forbidden
    404 Not Found
    418 I'm a Teapot
    500 Internal Server Error (Equivalent to segmentation fault in C)
    503 Service Unavailable

    GET /search?q=cats HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.google.com

    ...
    ? is a convention to pass user input. q means query.

    HTML: Hyper Text MarkUp Language. It's not a programming language.

    It has 2 main characteristics:
        Tags
        Attributes

    A server is a piece of software who's purpose in life is to respond to requests with responses

    <!DOCTYPE html> Document type declaration. Implicit declaration that we're using the latest version of html

<html lang="en"> Open html tag. lang is an Attribute that modifies the default behavior
    <head>
        <title>
            hello, title
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        hello, body
    </body>
</html> Close html tag

Everything inside the html tag is an html element
A browser reads code and converts it into data structures and reads them into memory

CSS

Html has very limited support for aesthetics. CSS is another markup language.

CSS have properties (key:value pairs)

type selector
class selector
ID selector
Attribute selector
...

Frameworks:
Libraries other people wrote.
Classes:
Is a collection of key value pairs that you get to invent for yourself

JavaScript: an actual programming language
    It supports conditionals
