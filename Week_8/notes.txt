Internet
    The early days of the Internet:
    The internet started by connecting universities with ArpaNet

    Routing decisions and routers:

    Data takes routes. That's why it's called a router.
    Data can take different paths from A to B.

    TCP/IP:
    They do 2 things:
        IP: Internet Protocol. Allow computers to know how to address information. They're protocols full of conditionals.
        IP decides that every computer of the world have a unique address. #.#.#.# Dotted decimal notation.
        The numbers uniquely identify computers around the world. Each number goes up to 255. An IP address is 32 bits in total.
        We can have a total of 4 billion computers on the internet at once. There's a newer version of IP called IPv6 that uses 128 bits.
